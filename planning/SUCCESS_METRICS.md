# Skylapse Success Metrics

## Personal Project Success Criteria

### 🎯 Primary Success Metrics

#### Technical Performance
- [ ] **Capture Latency**: <50ms average (measured with benchmark script)
- [ ] **System Uptime**: >95% during capture windows (measured over 30 days)
- [ ] **Focus Accuracy**: <2s focus acquisition for landscape distances
- [ ] **Storage Management**: Automatic cleanup maintains <80% disk usage

#### Image Quality
- [ ] **Sharp Images**: >90% of captures pass sharpness threshold
- [ ] **Proper Exposure**: <5% over/under-exposed images in normal conditions
- [ ] **Color Accuracy**: Consistent white balance across sequences
- [ ] **Noise Levels**: Acceptable noise in processed images up to ISO 800

#### Timelapse Output
- [ ] **Smooth Motion**: No visible flicker or exposure jumps
- [ ] **Stability**: Minimal camera shake or drift
- [ ] **Quality**: 4K output suitable for large screen viewing
- [ ] **Processing Speed**: Complete daily timelapse within 2 hours of capture end

### 🏠 Personal Experience Metrics

#### Setup & Installation
- [ ] **Setup Time**: Complete installation in <4 hours (including mounting)
- [ ] **Documentation Quality**: Can follow setup guide without external help
- [ ] **Hardware Reliability**: No hardware failures in first 6 months
- [ ] **Weather Resistance**: Survives mountain weather conditions

#### Daily Operation
- [ ] **Maintenance Effort**: <30 minutes per month average maintenance
- [ ] **Reliability**: Runs unattended for 2+ weeks without intervention
- [ ] **Problem Resolution**: Can troubleshoot common issues in <1 hour
- [ ] **Content Access**: Can download timelapses in <5 minutes

#### Personal Satisfaction
- [ ] **Output Quality**: Proud to share timelapses with friends/family
- [ ] **Learning Value**: Gained significant knowledge about camera systems
- [ ] **Project Completion**: Achieved original vision for the system
- [ ] **Ongoing Use**: Still actively using system after 6 months

### 📊 Measurement Methods

#### Automated Metrics
```bash
# System performance monitoring
./scripts/measure-performance.sh --duration=24h

# Image quality analysis
./scripts/analyze-image-quality.sh --batch=latest-100

# Storage and uptime tracking
./scripts/system-health-report.sh --period=30d
```

#### Manual Assessment
- **Weekly**: Review latest timelapses for quality
- **Monthly**: Check system health and maintenance needs
- **Quarterly**: Assess overall satisfaction and learning progress

### 🎯 Sprint Success Criteria

#### Sprint 1 (MVP)
- [ ] Camera captures photos on schedule
- [ ] Basic processing pipeline works end-to-end
- [ ] Can generate simple timelapse video
- [ ] System runs reliably for 1 week unattended

#### Sprint 2 (Quality)
- [ ] HDR processing improves image quality
- [ ] Adaptive exposure based on conditions
- [ ] Web interface for monitoring
- [ ] Automated cleanup and maintenance

#### Sprint 3 (Polish)
- [ ] Mobile app for remote monitoring
- [ ] Advanced processing features (focus stacking, etc.)
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] System optimized for long-term operation

### 🚨 Failure Criteria (When to Pivot)

If any of these occur, reassess approach:
- [ ] Cannot achieve <100ms capture latency consistently
- [ ] System requires daily intervention to keep running
- [ ] Image quality is worse than smartphone timelapse
- [ ] Setup process takes >8 hours for technical person
- [ ] Hardware costs exceed $500 for basic setup

### 📈 Success Tracking

#### Weekly Review Questions
1. What worked well this week?
2. What problems did I encounter?
3. Are we on track for sprint goals?
4. What should I focus on next week?

#### Monthly Assessment
1. How satisfied am I with the current system?
2. What features are most/least valuable?
3. What would I change about the approach?
4. Is this still worth the time investment?
