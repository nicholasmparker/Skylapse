# Skylapse

**Automatic sunrise, daytime, and sunset timelapses with smart exposure and image stacking.**

## What This Does

Three simple timelapses, captured automatically every day:
- üåÖ **Sunrise** - 30 second intervals, 1 hour duration
- ‚òÄÔ∏è **Daytime** - 5 minute intervals, 6 hours duration
- üåá **Sunset** - 30 second intervals, 1 hour duration

Camera settings adjust automatically to light conditions. Sunrise and sunset images are stacked for higher quality.

## Architecture

Three components:
1. **Raspberry Pi** - Captures photos when commanded
2. **Backend** - Brain that schedules, calculates exposure, processes images
3. **Frontend** - Simple UI to watch today's timelapses

See [`SIMPLE_ARCHITECTURE.md`](SIMPLE_ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete details.

## Quick Start

**Requirements:**
- Raspberry Pi with camera (for capture)
- Docker (for backend/frontend development)

**Development:**
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend: http://localhost:8082
```

**Deploy:**
```bash
# Deploy capture service to Pi
./scripts/deploy-pi.sh

# Deploy backend/frontend
./scripts/deploy-server.sh
```

## Development Status

üöß **Fresh start** - Old complex codebase archived, rebuilding with simplicity first.
