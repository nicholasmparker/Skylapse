# Quick Summary: Technical Debt Analysis

**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Sprint**: Sprint 1, Week 1 (Days 1-4)

---

## TL;DR

**CONDITIONAL GO** - Proceed to Pi integration after fixing 2 issues (3 hours work)

## Key Disagreements with QA

| QA Says                  | I Say                   | Why                                     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 3 CRITICAL issues        | 2 HIGH issues           | QA confuses enterprise vs MVP standards |
| 8-13 hours of fixes      | 2.25 hours of fixes     | QA over-engineers solutions             |
| Need comprehensive tests | Defer tests to Week 2-3 | Test after code stabilizes              |
| Cache is memory leak     | Cache is fine           | Grows 200 bytes/day = negligible        |
| Race condition exists    | FastAPI prevents this   | Framework guarantees init order         |
| Hardcoded names are debt | Intentional simplicity  | Per LESSONS_LEARNED.md                  |

## What to Fix (Before Week 2)

### 1. Config Validation (2 hours)

**File**: `/Users/nicholasmparker/Projects/skylapse/backend/main.py`
**Problem**: Malformed config could crash scheduler
**Fix**: Add safe defaults and validation

### 2. Timezone-Aware Datetime (15 minutes)

**File**: `/Users/nicholasmparker/Projects/skylapse/backend/exposure.py:40`
**Problem**: Naive datetime breaks comparisons
**Fix**: Use solar_calculator.timezone

**Total**: 2.25 hours

---

## What to DEFER

1. Solar cache eviction (Sprint 2, if ever)
2. HTTP connection pooling (premature optimization)
3. Camera settings validation (need Pi first)
4. Hardcoded schedule names (Sprint 3 feature)
5. Comprehensive unit tests (write in Week 2-3)

---

## Test Strategy

**Sprint 1 Week 1**: No tests (focus on implementation)
**Sprint 1 Week 2-3**: Unit tests for core logic (3-4 hours, 60-70% coverage)
**Sprint 2**: Integration tests with Pi (2 hours)

**QA wants tests now. I say wait until code stabilizes.**

---

## Code Quality Assessment

**Simplicity**: 9/10 (excellent adherence to "simple first")
**MVP Readiness**: 8/10 (minor fixes needed)
**Production Readiness**: 5/10 (but that's okay for Week 1)

**Compared to old codebase**: Massive improvement in focus and simplicity

---

## Bottom Line

QA is applying **enterprise production standards** to an **MVP Week 1**.

Most flagged issues are either:

- Intentional simplicity (hardcoded schedules)
- Premature optimization (connection pooling)
- False positives (race conditions)

**The code is solid. Fix 2 issues. Ship it. Learn from Pi integration.**

---

## Next Steps

1. **Engineering**: Fix 2 issues (half day)
2. **QA**: Review analysis, align on MVP standards
3. **Product**: Confirm Sprint 1 scope
4. **All**: Proceed to Week 2 (Pi integration)
