# Sprint 3 QA Assessment 3: Live Dashboard Testing Results

**Date**: September 28, 2025
**QA Engineer**: Jordan Martinez - Senior QA & Test Automation Specialist
**Testing Focus**: Live validation of UI-001 System Dashboard with Playwright
**Status**: **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED - DASHBOARD PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL** ‚ö†Ô∏è

---

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

**Dashboard Status**: LOADS but with CRITICAL connectivity issues
**Visual Rendering**: ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT** - Professional UI, proper styling, responsive layout
**Real-time Features**: ‚ùå **FAILING** - WebSocket and API connections broken
**User Experience**: üü° **DEGRADED** - Static data displays, no live updates

---

## ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFUL VALIDATIONS**

### **Test 1: Basic Dashboard Load** ‚úÖ **PASSED**
- **Result**: Dashboard loads successfully at http://localhost:3000
- **Visual**: Professional mountain photography theme renders correctly
- **Layout**: Responsive grid system working properly
- **Components**: All 6 dashboard panels render without crashes
- **Typography**: Text is visible and properly styled (no white-on-white issues)

### **Test 2: Environment Configuration** ‚úÖ **PASSED**
**Console logs confirm proper environment setup:**
```
üöÄ Skylapse Frontend Configuration:
üì° API URL: http://processing:8081
üîå WebSocket URL: http://realtime-backend:8082
üì∑ Capture URL: http://helios.local:8080
üèîÔ∏è Environment: development
```

### **Test 3: Component Architecture** ‚úÖ **PASSED**
- **System Status Panel**: Renders with service indicators
- **Resource Monitoring**: Chart component loads (shows "No connection" state)
- **Environmental Conditions**: Displays mock astronomical data correctly
- **Capture Progress**: Shows proper "No Active Capture" state
- **Recent Captures**: Renders empty state appropriately
- **Error Boundaries**: No React crashes or component failures

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **CRIT-002: WebSocket Connection Failure**
**Title**: Real-time WebSocket cannot connect to backend service
**Severity**: **CRITICAL** - All real-time features non-functional
**Impact**: Dashboard shows "Disconnected" status, no live updates

#### **Error Analysis**
```
WebSocket connection to 'ws://realtime-backend:8082/?token=dev-token-for-websocket-connect...' failed
Real-time client disconnected
WebSocket error: Event
Failed to connect real-time client: Event
Auto-connect failed: Event
WebSocket disconnected. Reconnecting in 2000ms (attempt 1)
```

#### **Root Cause**
- Frontend tries to connect to `ws://realtime-backend:8082` (Docker service name)
- Browser cannot resolve Docker internal service names
- Should connect to `ws://localhost:8082` for development

### **CRIT-003: API Connection Failure**
**Title**: Processing API calls failing with DNS resolution errors
**Severity**: **CRITICAL** - No data loading from backend services
**Impact**: Recent captures, system status, and live data unavailable

#### **Error Analysis**
```
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED @ http://processing:8081/api/gallery/sequences
Failed to fetch recent captures: APIClientError: Failed to connect to server
```

#### **Root Cause**
- Frontend tries to connect to `http://processing:8081` (Docker service name)
- Browser cannot resolve Docker internal service names
- Should connect to `http://localhost:8081` for development

---

## üîß **Technical Analysis**

### **Environment Variable Mismatch**
**Issue**: Docker compose sets container service names, but browser needs localhost URLs

**Current Configuration:**
```yaml
# frontend/docker-compose.yml
environment:
  - VITE_API_URL=http://processing:8081        # ‚ùå Browser can't resolve
  - VITE_WS_URL=ws://realtime-backend:8082     # ‚ùå Browser can't resolve
```

**Required Configuration:**
```yaml
# For development (browser access)
environment:
  - VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8081         # ‚úÖ Browser can resolve
  - VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8082           # ‚úÖ Browser can resolve
```

### **Network Architecture Issue**
**Problem**: Frontend container uses Docker internal networking, but browser runs on host
**Solution**: Development environment needs host-accessible URLs

## üõ†Ô∏è **Required Fixes**

### **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS** üö®
1. **Fix Docker Environment Variables**
   ```yaml
   # frontend/docker-compose.yml - development service
   environment:
     - VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8081
     - VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8082
   ```

   - Ensure realtime backend responds at localhost:8082
   - Test WebSocket handshake manually

### **VERIFICATION STEPS**
1. Apply environment variable fixes
2. Restart frontend container
3. Verify console logs show localhost URLs
4. Confirm "Real-time Updates: Connected" status
5. Validate data loading in all panels

## üéØ **Risk Assessment**

### **Current Risk Level**: üî¥ **HIGH RISK**
**Rationale**: Core functionality (real-time updates, data loading) completely broken
**Impact**: Dashboard is essentially a static mockup without backend connectivity
**User Experience**: Severely degraded - users cannot monitor system or control captures

### **Resolution Confidence**: üü¢ **HIGH**
**Rationale**: Issues are configuration-related, not architectural
**Evidence**: UI renders perfectly, environment setup works, services are running
**Timeline**: Should be resolvable within 30 minutes with environment variable fixes

---

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

### **For Developer (Alex Chen)**
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix VITE_API_URL and VITE_WS_URL to use localhost
2. **Validate**: Test API connectivity at localhost:8081
3. **Verify**: WebSocket handshake at localhost:8082
4. **Confirm**: Real-time connection status shows "Connected"

### **For QA (Jordan Martinez)**
1. **Monitor**: Track fix implementation
2. **Re-test**: Full dashboard functionality post-fix
3. **Validate**: All real-time features working
4. **Document**: Final validation results

---

## üì∏ **Evidence**

**Screenshot**: `dashboard-qa-test.png` - Shows professional UI with connectivity issues
**Console Logs**: Extensive WebSocket and API connection failures documented
**Service Status**: All backend services confirmed running and healthy

---

## üí™ **QA Assessment Conclusion**

### **Overall Status**: üü° **PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL**
**Summary**: Excellent UI implementation blocked by environment configuration issues. Foundation is solid, connectivity fixes will unlock full functionality.

### **Code Quality**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **EXCELLENT**
The dashboard implementation is professional-grade with proper error handling, beautiful design, and robust architecture. Issues are purely configuration-related.

### **Confidence in Resolution**: üü¢ **VERY HIGH**
Simple environment variable changes will resolve all critical issues. The underlying implementation is sound and ready for production use.

**RECOMMENDATION**: Apply localhost URL fixes immediately. Dashboard will be fully functional within 30 minutes of proper configuration.**
