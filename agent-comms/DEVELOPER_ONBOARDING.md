## üìã Project Overview

You're joining the Skylapse project - a professional mountain timelapse system using Raspberry Pi with intelligent camera control and advanced image processing. This is a personal project with potential for open-source community sharing.

### Key Architecture Points
- **Two-service system**: Native Pi capture + Docker processing
- **Target performance**: <50ms capture latency, 99.5% uptime
- **Primary hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4B + Arducam IMX519 16MP camera
- **Tech stack**: Python, libcamera, systemd, Docker, YAML configs
- **Development**: SSH to Pi (helios) for capture dev, Docker for processing

## üéØ Your Role & Responsibilities

### Primary Focus
You are responsible for **implementing the capture service** that runs natively on the Raspberry Pi. This is the performance-critical component that directly controls the camera hardware.

### Core Responsibilities
1. **Camera Integration**: Implement camera factory pattern with libcamera
2. **Scheduling System**: Build astronomical timing and adaptive capture intervals
3. **Storage Management**: Organize photos with metadata and automatic cleanup
4. **System Reliability**: Ensure robust operation with proper error handling
5. **Performance Optimization**: Achieve <50ms capture latency targets

### What You DON'T Handle
- Image processing pipeline (Docker service - separate developer)
- Web interface/mobile app (future sprint)
- Hardware procurement or physical setup
- Project management or sprint planning

## üìã Current Sprint Assignment

### Sprint 1: Foundation & First Capture
**Duration**: Sept 25 - Oct 9, 2025  
**Goal**: Get basic photo capture working reliably

### Your Assigned User Stories

#### üî¥ Must Have (Critical Path)
1. **CAP-001**: Camera detection and initialization

   - Proper error handling and logging

2. **CAP-002**: Scheduled sunrise/sunset capture  
   - Astronomical calculations (recommend astral library)
   - Adaptive intervals (2-5s golden hour, 30-60s day)
   - Reliable scheduling system

3. **CAP-004**: Local storage with organization
   - YYYY/MM/DD folder structure
   - Metadata preservation
   - RAW format support

#### üü° Should Have (Important)

## üó£Ô∏è Communication Protocol

### Daily Updates (Required)
**Format**: Update `planning/SPRINT-1.md` daily progress log
```markdown
#### Day X - [Date]
- **Completed**: [What you finished]
- **Blocked**: [Any blockers or issues]
- **Next**: [Tomorrow's focus]
```

### Weekly Check-ins
**When**: Every Wednesday at 2pm  
**Format**: Brief status update to PM
- Stories completed vs planned

**Scope changes**: Always check with PM before changing requirements

### Code Reviews
- Self-review against acceptance criteria
- Test coverage required for all features
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Documentation updates for new features

## üöß Known Challenges & Guidance

### Technical Challenges
1. **libcamera Complexity**: Start simple, iterate. Use existing examples.
2. **Timing Precision**: Critical for exposure bracketing - use high-resolution timers
3. **Hardware Access**: Direct GPIO/I2C access required - avoid Docker for capture
4. **Error Recovery**: Mountain conditions are harsh - robust error handling essential

### Development Approach
1. **Start with Mock Camera**: Get logic working before hardware integration
2. **Incremental Development**: Get basic capture working, then add features
3. **Test Early and Often**: Hardware integration can be tricky
4. **Follow Architecture**: Use factory pattern and abstraction layers as designed
