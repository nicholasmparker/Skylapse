## üöß Testing Challenges & Approach

### Hardware Testing Challenges
1. **Limited Hardware Access**: Coordinate Pi access with development team
2. **Environmental Simulation**: Create realistic test conditions when possible
3. **Timing Precision**: Use high-resolution timing for latency measurements
4. **Hardware Failures**: Simulate hardware failures safely

### Testing Strategy
1. **Start with Simulation**: Use mock camera for initial testing
2. **Progress to Hardware**: Validate on actual Pi + camera setup
3. **Stress Testing**: Push system beyond normal operating conditions
4. **Long-Running Tests**: Validate stability over extended periods

### Risk Mitigation
- **Test Early**: Begin testing as soon as basic functionality is available
- **Automate Critical Paths**: Ensure regression prevention for core features
- **Document Everything**: Detailed test results for future reference
- **Collaborate Closely**: Work with developers to understand implementation details
