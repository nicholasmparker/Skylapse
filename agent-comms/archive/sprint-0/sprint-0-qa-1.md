## üîç Test Environment Assessment

### Current State Analysis
‚úÖ **Positive Findings:**
- Comprehensive code structure already in place
- 54 test cases written covering core functionality
- Good test coverage across camera controller, environmental sensing, and mock camera
- Well-structured test configuration with fixtures
- Dependencies properly defined in requirements.txt

üö® **Critical Issues Identified:**

#### **CRITICAL: Test Configuration Problems**
- **Issue**: Async fixture configuration causing 21 test failures and 13 errors
- **Root Cause**: pytest-asyncio fixture decorators not properly configured
- **Impact**: Cannot validate any functionality until test suite is operational
- **Priority**: Must fix immediately before any development validation

#### **HIGH: Missing Hardware Integration Tests**
- **Issue**: No tests for actual Pi camera hardware integration
- **Impact**: Cannot validate CAP-001 (camera detection) on real hardware
- **Recommendation**: Need hardware-specific test suite for helios Pi

#### **HIGH: Performance Testing Gap**
- **Issue**: No automated performance benchmarking for <50ms capture latency requirement
- **Impact**: Cannot validate critical performance targets
- **Recommendation**: Implement automated latency measurement
