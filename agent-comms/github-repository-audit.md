## 🚀 **Recommendations for Future**

### **Branch Protection** (Optional Enhancement)
```bash
# Consider adding branch protection to main
gh api repos/nicholasmparker/Skylapse/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["ci"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=false \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":1}'
```

### **Repository Description** (Enhancement)
Current description is empty. Consider adding:
```
"Professional mountain timelapse capture system with intelligent scheduling, HDR processing, and real-time monitoring for Raspberry Pi hardware."
```

### **GitHub Actions Status** ✅
CI workflow is present and functional for code quality validation.
